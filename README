toiletline
----------------
Single-file framework library for raw terminal applications,
meant to replace a small subset of GNU Readline.

It allows you to input characters, press up and down keys to navigate history,
left and right to navigate line, all while in raw mode.

Accepts UTF-8 characters. For very specific cases, parsed UTF-8 may not be valid.

Any help finding bugs is appreciated.

Current features
----------------
- Up/Down to navigate history.
- Right/Left, End/Home to navigate line.
- Enter to submit the line.
- CTRL-C to exit

Usage
----------------
#define TOILETLINE_IMPL
Before you include this file in C or C++ file to create the implementation.

To initialize toiletline mode, use:
bool tl_init(void);

To read lines while in toiletline mode, use:
int tl_readline(char *line_buffer, size_t size);
Submitted input will be written to *line_buffer as a null-terminated string.

To exit, use:
bool tl_exit(void);

For example program, take a look at test.c.
