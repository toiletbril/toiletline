toiletline
----------------
Single-file framework library for raw terminal applications,
meant to replace a small subset of GNU Readline.

Accepts UTF-8 characters. For very specific cases, parsed UTF-8 may not be valid.

Notes
----------------
On Windows, the console API doesn't support reading multibyte UTF-8 input, instead replacing it with \0 bytes.
This means only ASCII characters are supported.

Any help finding bugs is appreciated.

Usage
----------------
#define TOILETLINE_IMPL
Before you include this file in C or C++ file to create the implementation.
