toiletline
----------------
Single-file framework library for raw terminal applications,
meant to replace a small subset of GNU Readline.

It allows you to input characters, press up and down keys to navigate history,
left and right to navigate in the line, all while in raw mode.

Accepts UTF-8 characters. For very specific cases, parsed UTF-8 may not be valid.

Notes
----------------
Any help finding bugs is appreciated.

Usage
----------------
#define TOILETLINE_IMPL
Before you include this file in C or C++ file to create the implementation.
