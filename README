toiletline
----------------
C framework for raw terminal applications, meant to be a tiny replacement for GNU Readline.
Accepts UTF-8 input. Parsed UTF-8 is not guranteed to be valid.

#define TOILETLINE_IMPL
Before you include this file in C or C++ file to create the implementation.

This probably contains 103 memory leaks an secret segfaults. Any help is appreciated.

Notes
----------------
Does NOT work on Windows but crashes under mysterious circustances. Works flawlessly on Linux.
